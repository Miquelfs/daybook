## 2026-07-06 (night) — Fix 409 on Add Holding; surface real API error messages

### Fixed
- **Adding a holding could 409 forever with no explanation.** `create_holding`
  keys each row on a deterministic `account+ticker` id and blocked re-creation
  whenever that id already existed — even if the existing row was `is_active=0`
  (fully sold). Selling a position to zero and later buying back into the same
  ticker/account was permanently blocked. Now: an existing **active** holding
  still 409s (you should use "Buy more" instead), but an existing **inactive**
  one is revived — the row is updated in place and reactivated rather than
  treated as a conflict.
- **The 409 (or any failed mutation) showed a useless message** — the
  frontend's `post`/`patch`/`del`/`proxyPost`/`proxyPatch`/`proxyDel` helpers
  in `lib/money-api.ts` discarded the response body on failure and threw a bare
  `POST ... failed 409`, which is exactly the unhelpful text users were seeing.
  They now parse the FastAPI `{"detail": "..."}` body and surface that message
  instead, falling back to the generic string only if the body isn't JSON.
  Fixes every money-module mutation's error display at once, not just holdings.

## 2026-07-06 (evening) — Root-cause fix for every overlapping modal; live prices; buy/avg-cost-basis

### Fixed
- **All modal overlap, everywhere** (not just Add Holding): the page-load
  stagger animation used `animation-fill-mode: both`. Per spec, an element
  with a forwards/both-filling transform animation permanently acts as a
  containing block for `position: fixed` descendants — even once the
  animation settles at `transform: none`. That trapped every full-screen
  sheet (add holding, add expense, add flight, sell, the photo lightbox)
  inside whatever page section it was nested under instead of the real
  viewport. Changed `both` → `backwards`: keeps the entrance stagger, drops
  the permanent trap once the 0.45s animation completes.
- **P&L was reading real numbers as garbage** because "Cost basis €" asked
  for a *total* but reads like "price per unit" — a natural mix-up that
  silently produced 100s-of-percent P&L. The field is now "Avg. buy-in
  price € / unit" with the total shown live underneath before you submit.

### Added
- **Live price on creation** — adding a holding now fetches today's price
  synchronously (`domains/money/price_sync.py: sync_price_now`) instead of
  waiting for the nightly cron; falls back silently to "price pending" if
  the fetch fails, exactly as before.
- **Buy more** (the DCA counterpart to Sell): updates quantity and
  recomputes a true weighted-average cost basis, books the purchase as a
  Finance transaction debiting a chosen funding account. Fetches a live
  price if none is given. `POST /money/portfolio/holdings/{id}/buy`.

## 2026-07-06 (later still) — Merge Training's two half-empty cards into one

### Changed
- The Today/day-view Training section showed readiness (form, roster badge)
  and the rest-day/session list as two separate bordered cards — often both
  mostly whitespace (e.g. just "-2 form · optimal" and a roster badge sitting
  alone in their own box). Merged into a single card: readiness becomes a
  compact header row (bottom-divided), sessions render as divided rows
  instead of individually-bordered buttons, and the rest-day message sits
  directly below the header with no gap. `ReadinessBar` renamed
  `ReadinessHeader` to reflect the new role.

---

## 2026-07-06 (later) — Feedback round: fonts back, light-mode fixes, sell holdings, compact Today

### Fixed
- **Sheets were invisible in light mode** — the bottom sheets (add expense,
  add flight) use `bg-[#09090B]`, which light mode remapped to transparent
  (meant only for the body). This is why "add money from the day view" and
  "add manual flight" broke. Panels now get solid paper; only the body stays
  transparent for the atmosphere.
- **Light-mode legibility pass**: muted inks darkened several steps, native
  date/time/select controls follow the theme via `color-scheme`, form
  controls get guaranteed ink text, zinc-named grays remapped, solid amber
  deepened, gauge zone labels readable.
- Fonts reverted to Geist / Geist Mono (web) and system nav titles (iOS).

### Changed
- **Photo card**: Today/Yesterday switch removed — upload lives on each
  day's page (any past day works, replace included).
- **Today header**: prev/next arrows moved inline next to the date (plus a
  "Now" pill on past days) — one row instead of two, much less phone space.
- **Training strip**: body battery removed (already in the health KPIs);
  readiness is now a ring gauge, recovery state a labeled dot, form (TSB)
  color-coded with its zone name.

### Added
- **Sell / delete holdings** on /money/portfolio: per-row actions; the sell
  sheet books proceeds as a Finance transaction into a chosen liquid account
  (partial sales reduce cost basis proportionally, selling all closes the
  holding). `POST /money/portfolio/holdings/{id}/sell`.

### iOS production readiness
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` added (receipt scanner would crash without it),
  `NSFinancialDataUsageDescription` added, deployment target 16.4 → 17.0
  (the app uses iOS 17 APIs).

---

## 2026-07-06 — Full tag management, light mode, design identity, photo backfill

### Added — Tags
- **Tag manager** at `/tags` (linked from the picker): inline rename, emoji
  re-icon, move between categories, delete with confirm (system tags locked),
  new tags per category, and **new categories** (a category is born with its
  first tag). `PATCH /tags/{id}` now accepts name/icon/category/color;
  TagPicker shows user-created categories.

### Added — Theme & design ("a pilot's logbook")
- **Light mode: paper chart** — warm paper surfaces, ink text, faint chart
  grid; **dark stays the cockpit** with a subtle amber glow. Toggle in the nav,
  persisted, no flash on load. Implemented as compiled-utility remaps so the
  whole app flips without touching every page.
- **Typography identity**: Fraunces (serif display, h1/h2), Alegreya Sans
  (body), IBM Plex Mono (section labels + all tabular figures — instrument
  readouts).
- **Motion**: one staggered page-load rise (CSS only, reduced-motion aware).
- **iOS**: all db* tokens are now light/dark adaptive (same paper palette),
  Appearance setting (Cockpit / Paper chart / System) in Settings, and serif
  navigation titles via the New York design.

### Fixed — Photos
- Past days without a photo showed a dead placeholder — **upload now works on
  any day** (replace too), matching the original backfill intent.
- **Today/Yesterday switch** on the photo card (web Today page + iOS Today
  tab) for days that roll past midnight.

---

## 2026-07-04 — Trips mean nights away; explore year filter everywhere; place detail v2

### Changed
- **Trip detection is nights-based**: a trip = consecutive nights where the
  *last observation of the day* is outside the active home's radius. A pilot's
  day-trips that end back in their own bed no longer count; single-night
  layovers do. Sleeping at home breaks a trip; ≤3 no-data days between away
  nights are bridged. Recomputed windows are wiped before upsert so rule
  changes never leave stale trips.
- **Explore year filter now applies to everything** — world coverage,
  fun facts and trips all accept `?year=` (cache keyed per year).
- **"Days abroad" → "Days tracked"** using a new `distinct_days` count — a day
  touching two countries was previously counted twice.
- **Highest point** now also scans Garmin activity altitude streams (labelled
  by source) — the phone rarely tracks in flight.

### Added
- Trips gallery grouped by year with per-year night totals; each card links to
  the trip's first day. Cards show departure home ("from Mallorca").
- Place detail v2: map pin (Leaflet, dark tiles), first/last visit cards
  linking to those days, paginated visits (10 at a time + load more);
  `GET /locations/place-summary`, `place-dates` gains `limit/offset`.
- Hourly cache warmers for world-coverage + fun-facts in `daily_sync.sh` —
  /explore is never cold.
- Manual coords fallback in `backfill_home_coords.py` (Grassobio fails
  Nominatim; OSM spells it Grassobbio).

## 2026-07-03 — Money intelligence, maps narrative layer, sport curves, ops fixes

Full analysis + forward roadmap in `docs/PLAN_2026_07_03.md`. Checkpoint commit
captured the whole June–July build-out (portfolio+DCA, groceries, Omyra coach,
sleep, injuries, decisions, experiments, roster, AI layer) that had been
sitting uncommitted.

### Added — Money Intelligence (Plan A-II)
- **Adjusted budget velocity** — `FIXED_RECURRING_CATEGORIES` (`Home`) amortised
  over the month; `/money/overview` gains `adjusted_velocity`, fixed/discretionary
  splits and adjusted projections; fixed categories no longer fire pace alerts
- **4 new endpoints**: `GET /money/waterfall`, `/money/efficiency` (recoverable
  savings vs 25th-percentile caps), `/money/anomalies/monthly` (month-level
  Z-scores), `/money/seasonal` (Jan–Dec averages)
- **`/money/insights` page** — velocity gauge (adjusted/raw toggle), savings
  streak with 12-month dots, cash-flow waterfall, unusual-months timeline+cards,
  seasonal chart, daily-rhythm heat grid, efficiency table, history & forecast
- `variance_flag` on category/subcategory stats ((max−min) > 2× avg, >3 tx)

### Added — Maps narrative layer (Plan Phase B)
- **Home base** anchored on life-in-weeks location periods:
  `life_periods.centroid_lat/lng/home_radius_km` (+ `migrate_maps.py`),
  `domains/locations/backfill_home_coords.py` (Nominatim), `home_base.home_for(date)`
  with 30-day GPS-centroid fallback
- **Auto-detected trips** — `trips` table + `domains/locations/trip_detection.py`
  (>150 km from the home active that date, ≤1-day home gaps merged, <2 nights
  ignored); nightly step in `daily_sync.sh`; `GET /locations/trips`
- **World coverage** — `GET /locations/world-coverage` (32/197 countries — 16.2%),
  continent split, per-country first/last visit + days + cities;
  `domains/locations/countries.json`
- **Fun facts** — `GET /locations/fun-facts`: compass extremes (N/S/E/W with
  place+date), highest GPS point, farthest-from-home ever, Earth laps / Moon %,
  marathons-run equivalent, longest day/month, country diversity (Shannon),
  longest stretch abroad
- `/explore` shows world coverage bar, fun-facts strip, and trips gallery
- Country-name normalization moved to `domains/locations/country_names.py`
  (+ Estonia/Lithuania/Albania/Latvia and other missing mappings)

### Added — Sport-aware activity detail (Plan C.1)
- `SportCurveSection` — pace curve (runs) / speed curve (rides) with all-time
  vs last-90d lines and “this one” marker; sport color chip in the header
  (run=coral, ride=blue, swim=teal)

### Fixed / Ops
- **Morning brief** now generates once around 06h (05–08h window guard in
  `daily_sync.sh`), skips when today's brief exists; `--force` flag added and
  used by the regenerate endpoint
- **Grocery price sync** added to the nightly cron (06h) with a CLI entry on
  `price_tracker`
- ADR-004 records the two-client strategy (web=instrument, iOS=capture,
  Pi API=single contract)

## 2026-05-15–18 — Daily usability sprint: photo diary, questionnaire overhaul, money fixes, location tuning

### Added
- **Photo of the day** — full upload pipeline: `POST /days/{date}/photo`, HEIC→JPEG conversion via Pillow + pillow-heif, EXIF orientation correction, photos stored in `data/photos/` on Pi
- **Photo proxy route** — `GET /api/photos/[...path]` Next.js route forwards image requests same-origin (fixes mixed-content broken images in browser)
- **PhotoOfDay.tsx** — upload zone (gallery picker, no forced camera), thumbnail with tap-to-expand lightbox, replace-photo button; visible on both Today and all past day pages
- **Moments page** (`/moments`) — Instagram-style 3-column photo grid across all days; infinite scroll (90-day pages); lightbox with "View that day →" link; camera icon in nav
- **Photo dot on DayCard** — amber `●` indicator on timeline rows when a photo is logged for that day
- **`/day/[date]` photo section** — PhotoOfDay now shown on past day pages, enabling backfill uploads
- **Questionnaire — Today section redesign:**
  - Drinks: hidden by default; tap "Drinks" to reveal 1–8 count row + `✕` to clear; count shown inline in pill label
  - S.I.: tap to reveal 1–5 rating row (no "Rating" label)
  - Work, Outdoors, Social: toggle pills
  - All five in one compact row
- **Questionnaire — With section:** smart autocomplete — type a name and past names from 90-day history appear as suggestions; selected names shown as removable chips; new names saved as `with:Name` tags and available in future autocomplete
- **Questionnaire — Past 7 days collapsible:** shows last 7 answered rotating Q&A pairs
- **Account color badges** — 12 accounts mapped to distinct colors matching Notion palette (BBVA blue, Revolut purple, Sabadell sky, Trade Republic amber, etc.) in `TransactionList` and edit mode
- **`tags` field in DaySummary** — now returned from `GET /days` range endpoint; used by Questionnaire autocomplete for `with:` history
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — project-level instructions: deploy workflow, stack, CORS conventions, tags column convention, key directories

### Fixed
- **Money sign bug** — `isExpense()` now checks `amount < 0` (not `transaction_type`); daily total shows net correctly; reimbursements/income shown in green with `+` prefix; "Total spent" shows net not gross
- **Photo upload 500** — Next.js proxy was re-parsing and re-encoding multipart form data, stripping the boundary; fixed by forwarding raw `arrayBuffer()` with original `content-type` header
- **Photo upload threading** — FastAPI `async def upload_photo` ran in a different thread from the SQLite connection; converted to sync `def` so connection and DB writes share the same thread
- **Photo display after refresh** — `initialPhotoUrl` was a relative path (`/photos/...`) used as `<img src>` directly, loading from wrong port; fixed by routing all photo URLs through `/api/photos/` proxy
- **HEIC support** — iPhone HEIC photos now accepted and converted to JPEG server-side; any format Pillow can read is accepted
- **Leaflet CSS z-index** — moved `<link>` to `layout.tsx` head; added `isolate` + `position:relative` to map container; map no longer bleeds over expense list on desktop
- **Overland dwell thresholds** — `DWELL_MIN_MINUTES` 8→3, `MOVE_SPEED_MS` 0.8→2.0 (was triggering on normal walking GPS drift), `SPARSE_GAP_MINUTES` 60→30; sparse-tracking days now produce segments
- **Location pills cap** — Today view shows max 10 named stops, deduped, with "+N more" label

### Infrastructure
- **Pillow + pillow-heif** added to `requirements.txt`; installed on Pi via deploy pipeline
- **`make deploy`** now always does `rm -rf .next` before build to prevent stale cache serving old pages
- **CORS threading error** in `db_money.py` (`SQLite objects created in thread`) — known intermittent; connections created per-request via FastAPI `Depends(get_db)`, not shared across threads

### Tags column convention (documented in CLAUDE.md)
`days.tags` stores comma-separated structured tags:
- `work` — work day
- `si:N` — S.I. with optional satisfaction rating 1–5
- `with:Name` — person present; used for autocomplete history and future correlation analysis

---

## 2026-05-12–13 — Finance analytics, portfolio, category drill-down, charts

### Added
- 6 new API endpoints:
  - `GET /money/overview` — daily burn rate, projections, budget alerts
  - `GET /money/trends/historical` — MoM/YoY comparisons
  - `GET /money/trends/forecast` — 3-month weighted average forecast
  - `GET /money/portfolio` — net worth, investment vs liquid breakdown
  - `GET /money/spending/patterns` — spend by day-of-week and week-of-month
  - `GET /money/categories/stats` — all-time per-category totals
- `/money/overview` page — burn rate, projections, alert cards
- `/money/portfolio` page — net worth, allocation bar, account list with type badges
- `/money/category/[cat]` page — per-category drill-down with transaction list
- `MonthlyChart.tsx` — income vs expenses bar chart with MoM delta table

---

## 2026-05-15 — Pi production deployment: systemd, CORS, hardened deploy pipeline

### Infrastructure
- **Systemd services** installed on Pi: `daybook-api.service` + `daybook-web.service`
  - Both `enabled` — survive reboots automatically
  - `Restart=on-failure` — recover from crashes without manual intervention
  - Logs: `journalctl -u daybook-api -f` / `journalctl -u daybook-web -f`
- **`make deploy`** fully automated: rsync → `npm install` → `npm run build` → `sudo systemctl restart daybook-api daybook-web`
- **Cron** (`0 * * * *`): hourly Garmin + Overland + Notion sync via `daily_sync.sh`
- **Passwordless sudo** for systemctl restart: `/etc/sudoers.d/daybook`

### Fixed
- **CORS**: `CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://100.67.252.76:3000` added to Pi `.env` — unblocked all client-side React Query calls (TransactionList, Timeline, all charts)
- **rsync destroying Pi credentials**: added `--exclude='.env'` so Notion token and Garmin password on Pi are never overwritten by Mac's `.env`
- **rsync destroying Pi state**: added excludes for `*.db-wal`, `*.db-shm`, `infrastructure/scripts/logs/`, `nohup.out`
- **nohup fragility**: processes died when SSH session closed — replaced with systemd entirely

### Access
- Production URL: `http://100.67.252.76:3000` (Pi's Tailscale IP — consistent for SSR and browser API calls)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://100.67.252.76:8000` baked into the Next.js build

### Lessons learned
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are baked into the bundle at build time — the browser-facing URL must match `.env.local` at build time, not at runtime
- `nohup cmd &` via non-interactive SSH dies when the connection closes — systemd is the correct production pattern
- rsync `--delete` silently destroys Pi-only state — always audit excludes before adding new files to the project
- SSR pages bypass CORS (server-to-server); React Query client components do not — a CORS bug shows as a clean split between working SSR and broken client fetches
- Accessing the app from a URL different from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`'s origin causes client fetches to fail even with correct CORS headers — use the Tailscale IP consistently
